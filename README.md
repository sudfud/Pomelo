# Pomelo 0.1.0
 
Pomelo is a desktop media player with Youtube search, playback, and download functionality.

## Current features
- Play videos locally from the computer, with shuffle and reverse playback.

- Search for videos, channels, or playlists from Youtube.

- Play videos or playlists straight from Youtube.

- Download videos or playlists from Youtube.
 
## Known issues
- Searching and downloading might stop working, usually due to Youtube API changes. If this happens, try changing the Invidious and/or Yt-dlp settings.

- Downloads may be separated into 2 files for audio and video. This can usually be fixed by enabling the nightly build of yt-dlp.

- Downloads may be in different formats (mp4 or webm) or qualities. This presumably depends on if ffmpeg is installed. Format/Quality options will be added as development progresses.
